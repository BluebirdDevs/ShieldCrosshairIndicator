This mod makes it so when a player is blocking and you can disable it with an axe it shows a shield icon. When they aren't holding a shield (or its disabled in settings) it will show an icon when you can attack a player (or entity in settings).

## For Resourcepack Creators
If you want to change the icons you can find them in the mod at the following directories
```
shieldindicator:textures/gui/sprites/hud/indicator_crosshair
shieldindicator:textures/gui/sprites/hud/shield_crosshair
```
